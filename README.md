**Readme for Text Clustering Code**

This Jupyter Notebook contains Python code for text clustering using various techniques such as TF-IDF and KMeans clustering. Below is a brief overview of the code and instructions on how to use it.

### Overview:
The code consists of several code cells within this Jupyter Notebook. Each cell contains Python code for a specific functionality such as text preprocessing, feature extraction, and clustering. The main functionalities include:
1. Text preprocessing: Removing stopwords, punctuation, and lemmetization words.
2. Feature extraction: Using TF-IDF to convert text data into numerical features.
3. Clustering: Applying KMeans clustering algorithm to group similar text documents together.

### Code Structure:
- **Imports**: The first cell contains necessary imports for the code, including libraries such as NLTK.
- **Data Loading**: This cell contains code to load the input text data files for clustering. You can modify the paths to point to your data files.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Following cells perform text preprocessing tasks such as removing stopwords, punctuation, and lemmatization words.
- **Feature Extraction**: These cells extract features from the preprocessed text using TF-IDF techniques.
- **Clustering**: The final cells apply KMeans clustering algorithm to cluster the text data based on the extracted features.

### Usage:
1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed along with Python and the required libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the Jupyter Notebook file.
3. Update the paths in the code to point to your input text data files. Modify the paths in the "Data Loading" cell.
4. Run each cell sequentially to execute the text clustering process.
5. The Notebook will preprocess the text data, extract features, perform clustering, and evaluate the clustering results.
6. You can adjust the clustering parameters and preprocessing steps as needed by modifying the corresponding cells in the Notebook.
